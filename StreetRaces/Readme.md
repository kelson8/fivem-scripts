This code came from a forked repo, I cannot remember which one it was.

So far I have the following items working in the gui:
* Markers for creating races
* Saving races
* Listing races
* Deleting races

Still needs done: 
* Start race
* Cancel race
* Load race
* Leave race

Try to make this read the list of races from the json so the user can just select it from a list for loading, and deleting.

Keybind to bring up menu (F5) {I will try to add a config for this later on.}

All credit goes to the below author, I did not create this only expanded onto it. This will be released on github once I have it completed.
